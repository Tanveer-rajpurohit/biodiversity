							<h1>Threat &nbsp; to &nbsp; Biodiversity</h1>
							<p class="major">The term biodiversity was coined by E.O. Wilson (father of biodiversity) in 1985. The word biodiversity is split into two parts bio (life) and diversity (variability). It includes organisms like plants, animals, and microorganisms, as well as the genes and ecosystems they generate. An area’s biological structure influences biodiversity and cannot be measured purely by numbers.

								Whittaker (1972) identified three distinct categories of diversity: alpha, beta, and gamma. In the Convention of Biological Diversity (1992), biodiversity has been defined as the variability among living organisms from all sources including terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are a part.</p>

							<h2>habitat loss</h2>
							<p>Habitat loss, in ecology, the reduction or elimination of the space in which a species or community of organisms lives and reproduces. Habitat loss, which may be caused by natural disturbances (such as volcanic eruptions, floods, and landslides), is largely the product of human development of natural areas for profit (such as deforestation, strip mining, agriculture, and residential and commercial development) and resultant pollution. After a critical point of lost habitat, ecosystems may no longer be able to provide the environmental resources needed to ensure the survival of the plants, animals, and other forms of life that live there, increasing their chances of becoming extinct. Habitat loss is the leading cause of the global decline in biodiversity (see also biodiversity loss). There are three major types of habitat loss: habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation, and habitat degradation.</p>

							<h2>Poaching of Wildlife</h2>
							<p>The Problem Defined
								Poaching is illegal hunting, killing, capturing or taking of wildlife violating local or international wildlife conservation laws. Animal poaching endangers not only the population of targeted animals but also other animals in their ecosystem, as it often disrupts the essential balance of nature within a healthy biome.
								
								Poaching can cause populations to drastically plummet, ultimately resulting in extinction. The ripple effect can also imperil other flora and fauna existing within the same biome. Humans are the stewards of the natural world. It is our responsibility to protect wild areas and the animal and plant life that live within their boundaries</p>

							<h2>Man-Wildlife Conflict</h2>
							<p>Wildlife can threaten people’s safety and livelihoods, which can lead to conflicts between groups of people over how to resolve the situation; experts call this ‘human-wildlife conflict’.
								Human-wildlife conflicts are becoming more frequent, serious and widespread as human populations grow and habitats are lost.
								Effectively managing human-wildlife conflicts protects communities, stops conflicts escalating, builds trust in conservation and avoids retaliation against wildlife.
								Human-wildlife conflicts have unique ecological, cultural, social, historical, physical, economic and political characteristics which strategies to manage conflicts must consider.</p>

							<h2>Climate change and Pollution</h2>
							<p>Climate change and air pollution have been a matter of serious concern all over the world in the last few decades. The present review has been carried out in this concern over the Indian cities with significant impacts of both the climate change and air pollution on human health. The expanding urban areas with extreme climate events (high rainfall, extreme temperature, floods, and droughts) are posing human health risks. The intensified heat waves as a result of climate change have led to the elevation in temperature levels causing thermal discomfort and several health issues to urban residents. The study also covers the increasing air pollution levels above the prescribed standards for most of the Indian megacities. The aerosols and PM concentrations have been explored and hazardous health impacts of particles that are inhaled by humans and enter the respiratory system have also been discussed. The air quality during COVID-2019 lockdown in Indian cities with its health impacts has also been reviewed. Finally, the correlation between climate change, air pollution, and urbanizations has been presented as air pollutants (such as aerosols) affect the climate of Earth both directly (by absorption and scattering) and indirectly (by altering the cloud properties and radiation transfer processes). So, the present review will serve as a baseline data for policy makers in analyzing vulnerable regions and implementing mitigation plans for tackling air pollution. The adaptation and mitigation measures can be taken based on the review in Indian cities to reciprocate human health impacts by regular air pollution monitoring and addressing climate change as well.</p>

							<h2>Some other reasons</h2>
							<p>There are so many other reasons that are threat to our biodiversity like invasive Species,Extenction,overharvesting,overexploition,changes to how we use the land and water,extracting Natural resources,Acid rain,Ocean Acidification,deforestation,Human overpopulation,Desertification,Soil pollution.</p>
							<div class="items style1 medium onscroll-fade-in">
								<section style="background-color: #00B285;">
									
									<h3>Invasive Species</h3>
									<p>Another reason for the loss of biodiversity is the introduction of invasive species. Invasive species include any plants or animals that are unnatural or non-native to an ecosystem. These species threaten and often outcompete the plants and animals already present in a habitat.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Extinction</h3>
									<p>In the modern era, species and ecosystems are intimidated with destruction to an extent rarely seen in Earth’s history due to various human actions. It has threatened many species to the extent of extinction. While some species like Dinosaurs, Dodo, Tasmanian tigers, West African black rhinoceros, etc., are already extinct and visible only in the books in the form of pictures.</p>
								</section>
								<section style="background-color: #00B285;">
									
									<h3>Overharvesting</h3>
									<p>Overharvesting is a serious threat to many species, but particularly to aquatic species. There are many examples of regulated fisheries (including hunting of marine mammals and harvesting of crustaceans and other species) monitored by fisheries scientists that have nevertheless collapsed. The western Atlantic cod fishery is the most spectacular recent collapse. While it was a hugely productive fishery for 400 years, the introduction of modern factory trawlers in the 1980s and the pressure on the fishery led to it becoming unsustainable. The causes of fishery collapse are both economic and political in nature. Most fisheries are managed as a common resource, available to anyone willing to fish, even when the fishing territory lies within a country’s territorial waters. Common resources are subject to an economic pressure known as the tragedy of the commons, in which fishers have little motivation to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when they do not own the fishery. The general outcome of harvests of resources held in common is their overexploitation. While large fisheries are regulated to attempt to avoid this pressure, it still exists in the background. This overexploitation is exacerbated when access to the fishery is open and unregulated and when technology gives fishers the ability to overfish. In a few fisheries, the biological growth of the resource is less than the potential growth of the profits made from fishing if that time and money were invested elsewhere. In these cases—whales are an example—economic forces will drive toward fishing the population to extinction.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Overexploitation</h3>
									<p>Overexploitation remains a serious threat to many species and populations. Among the most commonly overexploited species or groups of species are marine fish and invertebrates, trees, and animals hunted for meat. Most industrial fisheries are either fully or overexploited, and the impacts of overharvesting are coupled to destructive fishing techniques that destroy habitat, as well as associated ecosystems such as estuaries and wetlands. Even recreational and subsistence fishing has contributed to what is known as the “shifting baselines” phenomenon, in which what we consider the norm today is dramatically different from pre-exploitation conditions.

										Many of the current concerns with overexploitation of bushmeat (wild meat taken from the forests by local people for income or subsistence) are similar to those of fisheries, where sustainable levels of exploitation remain poorly understood and where the offtake is difficult to manage effectively. Although the true extent of exploitation is poorly known, it is clear that rates of offtake are extremely high in tropical forests. The trade in wild plants and animals and their derivatives is poorly documented but is esti­mated at nearly $160 billion annually. It ranges from live animals for the food and pet trade to ornamental plants and timber. Because the trade in wild animals and plants crosses national borders, the effort to regulate it requires international cooperation to safeguard certain species from overexploitation</p>

								<section style="background-color: #00B285;">
									
									<h3>Changes to how we use the land and waters.</h3>
									<p>Both our lands and our seas contain many different ecosystems, and these are affected by business actions. For example: when developers drain and fill in marshes or wetlands in order to build housing, they take away the land that captures excess water during storms. The consequences can be drastic. When Superstorm Sandy hit New York and New Jersey in 2012, coastal marshland reduced damages by 27% (USD $430 million) in New Jersey, which had kept quite a bit of its marshes. In New York, where almost all the marshes had been drained and developed, marshland protection reduced damages by only 0.4% ($140 million).</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Extracting Natural Resources</h3>
									<p>Balancing the use of natural resources with the need to protect biodiversity is a complex challenge. Human societies depend on natural resources for their survival and development, but the excessive exploitation of these resources can have detrimental effects on ecosystems. Deforestation, overfishing, and the extraction of minerals are just a few examples of activities that can harm biodiversity.

										Unsustainable resource extraction is a leading cause of biodiversity decline. When natural resources are extracted in an unsustainable manner, it often results in habitat destruction and the disruption of ecosystems. This not only harms wildlife directly but also has cascading effects on the entire ecosystem. Finding ways to extract and utilize resources more sustainably is a critical step in mitigating the impact on biodiversity.</p>
								</section>
								<section style="background-color: #00B285;">
									
									<h3>Acid Rain</h3>
									<p>cid rain, or acid deposition, is a broad term that includes any form of precipitation with acidic components, such as sulfuric or nitric acid that fall to the ground from the atmosphere in wet or dry forms.  This can include rain, snow, fog, hail or even dust that is acidic.  </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Ocean acidification:</h3>
									<p> Increases in carbon dioxide levels are responsible for the acidification of oceans, which makes it difficult for marine organisms, like corals, plankton or shellfish, to maintain their protective coating. The result is a decline in these species’ populations, as well as those of species that rely on them for food and shelter</p>
								</section>
								<section style="background-color: #00B285;">
									
									<h3>Deforestation:</h3>
									<p>Forest ecosystems contain as much as 80 percent of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity and provide wood fiber and biomass energy as well as critical components of the global cycles of water, energy and nutrient. Forest ecosystems are being cleared and degraded in many parts of the world.

										Current projections suggest that demand for wood will roughly double over the next 50 years, which will make increasing use of sustainable forest practices more difficult. In addition to threats to biodiversity and potential shortages in the supply of forest products, the degradation of forests represents an enormous potential source of green house gas emissions.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Human Activity and Population</h3>
									<p>The increase in the population of humans has had a significant impact on biodiversity. About 200 years ago, less than 1 billion people were living on earth. By the year 2050, the population is expected to be at 9.8 billion people. 

										As the human population increases, the need for resources like food, water and shelter will increase, and more human activity will occur. Biodiversity is likely to decrease because of those needs, as well as urbanization and development. People will need places to live, work and play, so regions once filled with forests and diversity will become concrete jungles, forcing animals to leave their habitats and depleting the area of plants. </p>
								</section>
								<section style="background-color: #00B285;">
									
									<h3>Desertification:</h3>
									<p>Desertification and deforestation are the main causes of biodiversity loss. Both processes are decisively influenced by the extension of agriculture. The direct cost of deforestation is reflected in the loss of valuable plants and animal species. Desertification process is the result of poor land management which can be aggravated by climatic variations. Converting wild lands to agriculture often involves ploughing the soils which leads in temperate regions to an average decline in soil organic matter between 25 and 40 per cent over twenty five years.

										Decreasing soil organic matter is always a clear indication of soil degradation, and often is accompanied by reductions in water infiltration, fertility, and ability to retain fertilizers. Ploughing also exposes soils to wind and water erosion, resulting in large-scale pollution of freshwater resources.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									
									<h3>Soil pollution</h3>
									<p>Soil pollution is another factor adversely affecting biodiversity. Soil contaminated with heavy metals greatly impact the welfare of the microorganisms essential for the sustaining life of the living organisms. The excess of heavy metals present in the soil are not easily broken down and are accumulated by plants [12]. The over-use of fertilizers, pesticides and antibiotics used in agriculture is also very deleterious for the biodiversity. These agricultural pollutants such as nitrogen from fertilizers alter the pH and the nutrient level of the soil. The enhanced presence of nutrients in the soil causes the vigorous growth of grass species, leading to stifle in the growth of wildflowers, essential for bees and other pollinating insects [13]. This greatly impacts the biodiversity.</p>
