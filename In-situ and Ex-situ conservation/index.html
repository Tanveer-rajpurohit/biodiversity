		 Biodiversity is the variety of all forms of life and it is essential to the existence and proper functioning of all ecosystems.Conservation of biological diversity leads to conservation of essential ecological diversity to preserve the continuity of food chains.

		</p>
		<p>
			The enormous value of biodiversity due to their genetic, commercial medical,aesthetic,ecologyical,
			and optical importance emphasizes the need to conserve biodiversity.Many scientists believe biodiversity, as it represents all forms of life on earth, provides or supports the core benefits that humans derive from their environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			A number of  measures are now being taken the world over to conserve  biodiversity including plants and wildilfe. Genes regulate all biological 
			processes on the planet and increase the ability of organisms to cope with environmental stressors.

			In in situ conservation, the organisms or ecosystem is conserved in their natural surroundings.The Biosphere conserves some 
			representative ecosystem as a whole for long-term in situ conservation. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A national park ia an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment.it also meant for enjoyment through tourism
			 but without impairing the environment.First, the accessions of a variety stored at a germplasm bank and those of the same variety multiplied by farmers are jointly tested in the producers field and in the laboratory, under different situations and stresses.
		</p>
		<p>
			 While existing nature reserves or national parks are designed for the purpose of in situ conservation, this is normally
			  targeted at animal species, habitats or ecosystems rather than specific PGRFA.It is the process of protecting an endangered plant or animal species in its natural habitat, either
			  by protecting or cleaning up the habitat itself, or by defending the species from predators.  
		</p>
		<p>
			National Parks: A national park is an area which is strictly reserved for the betterment of the wildlife and where
			activities like forestry, grazing on cultivation are not permitted. In these parks, even private
			ownership rights are not allowed. 
			Some national park are:
			Gir national park in gujrat,Sarika in rajasthan,Bandipur in Karnatak,etc...
			</p>
			
				<p>
					Wildlife Sanctuaries: A sanctuary is a protected area which is reserved for the conservation of only animals and human
				   activities like harvesting of timber, collecting minor forest products and private ownership rights
				   are allowed as long as they do not interfere with well-being of animals. Boundaries of
				   sanctuaries are not well defined and controlled biotic interference is permitted, e.g., tourist
				   activity. 
				   Some wildlife sanctuaries are: Ghana Bird Sanctuary in rajasthan,Hazaribagh Sanctuary on bihar, etc...

		<div class="w960 text-center">
		<p>
			This typesof conservation is mainly done for conservation of crop variaties, the wild relatives of crop and all the 
			local variaties with the main object of conserving the total genetic variability of the crop species for future improvement or affores-tation progeammes.
		</p>
		<p>
			In, india, we have the following important genebank/seed bankfacilities. The G-15 countries have also resolved to set up
			a network of gene banks to facilitate the conservation of various variaties of aromatic and medicinal plants for which
			india is the networking co-ordinator country.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ex-situ Conservation is one of the primary objectives of Botanical Survey of India (BSI). It further supports the idea of reintroduction of species in its natural or original habitat as the species under varying threat perception are preserved in safe custody till the casual factors threatening their survival in the wild have been return to normalcy and the reintroduction becomes possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			1. Seed gene bank:
These are cold storages where seeds are kept under controlled temperature and humidity for
storage and this is easiest way to store the germ plasma of plants at low temperature. Seeds
preserved under controlled conditions (minus temperature) remain viable for long durations of
time.
</p>
<p>
2. Gene bank:
Genetic variability also is preserved by gene bank under normal growing conditions. These are
cold storages where germ plam are kept under controlled temperature and humidity for storage;
this is an important way of preserving the genetic resources. 
			</p>
			<p>
				3. Cryopreservation:
This is the newest application of technology for preservation of biotic parts. This type of
conservation is done at very low temperature (196°C) in liquid nitrogen. The metabolic activities
of the organisms are suspended under low temperature, which are later used for research
purposes. 
				</p>
				<p>
					4. Tissue culture bank:
Cryopreservation of disease free meristems is very helpful. Long term culture of excised roots
and shoots are maintained. Meristem culture is very popular in plant propagation as it’s a virus
and disease free method of multiplication. 
					</p>
					<p>
						5. Botanical gardens:
A botanical garden is a place where flowers, fruits and vegetables are grown. The botanical
gardens provide beauty and calm environment. Most of them have started keeping exotic plants
for educational and research purposes

				<h3>01. </h3>
				Biodiversity is important for the maintenance of a healthy environment and used for direct human benefits like food, medicine, and energy. It is also used for recycling of different essential elements, for mitigation of pollution.
				<h3>02. </h3>
				As a consequence, biodiversity of our planet is on the verge of decline and extinction despite our limited and incomplete knowledge on them [7]. Biodiversity loss and extinction processes can occur in two phases. The first phase is known as deterministic.
				<h3>03. </h3>
				The conservation of biodiversity refers to the protection, maintenance and study of living organisms and the way in which they interact with their surroundings.
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h3>04.</h3>
				In-situ biodiversity conservation is sparked by the vulnerability status of a species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the largest independent body responsible for keeping records on animal species and deciding their protection and vulnerability statuses.
				<h3>05. </h3>
				Biodiversity is an old concept, dating back to 2000 years ago in Greece. Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, made observations on the physiology and behaviour of different animals. Back then, our impact was relatively negligible
				<h3>06. </h3>
				Ex situ collection and storage of seeds or embryos is the most convenient and widely used method of genetic conservation. They are the natural dispersal, storage, or generative organs for the majority of species. This technique involves samples being collected from individuals or populations and then transferred to a gene bank for storage under controlled conditions, usually at subzero temperatures.
