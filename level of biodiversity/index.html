				<p> ⟫Definition:Ecosystem variety refers to the differences in ecosystems found within a given geographic area, as well as their overall impact on human life and the environment.
					It is a sort of biodiversity that pertains to species variety rather than ecosystem diversity. <br>
					<br>
					⟫Principles of Ecosystem Diversity

					The range of ecosystems found in a biosphere is also referred to as ecological diversity.
					An ecosystem is made up of a population of living species as well as physical elements like water, soil, and climate.
					The number of ecosystems found in a given area is the earliest definition of ecosystem biodiversity.
					The amount of ecological interactions among organisms in a given area is the second definition of ecosystem biodiversity.<br>

					⟫Importance: Essential for natural balance, providing services like clean air and water.<br>
					<br>
					⟫Types: Ecosystem diversity is defined as a form of diversity between ecosystems within a geographical location. An ecosystem is, in turn, defined as a system that includes all living organisms (biotic factors) and the physical environment (abiotic factors) functioning together as a unit. Ecosystems may be terrestrial, freshwater, marine, and artificial. <br>
					<br>
					⟫Threats: Anything that seeks to change the equilibrium of an ecosystem has the potential to endanger its health and existence. Some of these dangers are not excessively concerning since they may be remedied organically if natural circumstances are restored. Other causes can devastate ecosystems, causing all or some of their living forms to become extinct.  <br>
					<br>
                    ⟫Conservation: Conservation is the protection, preservation, and management of natural resources and ecosystems. It is essential for maintaining the balance of nature and ensuring the sustainability of our planet. Conservation efforts can range from protecting endangered species and their habitats to reducing pollution and promoting sustainable practices.<br>

				<h2 class="major"><b>Species diversity</b></h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="./images/2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>⟫ Defination: Species diversity is defined as the number of different species present in an ecosystem and relative abundance of each of those species.” <br> 
					<br>
					⟫Importance:In a healthy ecosystem, diverse and balanced number of species exist to maintain the balance of an ecosystem. In an ecosystem, all the species depend on each other directly or indirectly. So to make a more efficient, productive and sustainable ecosystem, it is important to maintain high species diversity. <br>
					<br> 
					⟫Threats:The world is facing an accelerated rate of extinction of species largely due to human activities. The four major causes of loss of diversity are known as “The Evil Quartet”.

				    These are:<br>1.Habitat Loss and Fragmentation<br>2. Over Exploitation<br> 3.Alien species invasions<br>4.Co-extinctions<br>
					<br>
					⟫Types:There are two constituents of species diversity:<br>

					Species richness: Number of different species present in an ecosystem. Tropical areas have greater species richness as the environment is conducive for a large number of species.<br>
					Species evenness: Relative abundance of individuals of each of those species. If the number of individuals within a species is fairly constant across communities, it is said to have a high evenness and if the number of individuals varies from species to species, it is said to have low evenness. High evenness leads to greater specific diversity <br>
					<br>
					⟫ Conservation: Biodiversity rich regions are protected as biosphere reserves, national parks and sanctuaries i.e. called in-situ conservation. Protecting Sunderbans for many endangered species like the royal Bengal tiger, olive ridley sea turtles, mangrove species etc.<br> Ex-situ conversation, where threatened and endangered species are identified, taken out and given full protection and kept in special reserves like botanical gardens, wildlife safari, etc. <br>

				<h2 class="major"><b>Genetic diversity</b></h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="./images/3.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""/></span>
				<p> ⟫ Defination: Genetic diversity is defined as genetic variability present within species.<br>

					Genetic diversity is the product of recombination of genetic material in the process of inheritance. It changes with time and space. <br>
					<br>
				    ⟫ Importance: Genetic diversity gives rise to different physical attributes to the individual and capacity to adapt to stress, diseases and unfavourable environmental conditions.<br>
					Environmental changes that are natural or due to human intervention, lead to the natural selection and survival of the fittest. Hence, due to genetic diversity, the varieties that are susceptible, die and the ones who can adapt to changes will survive.<br>
					Genetic diversity is important for a healthy population by maintaining different varieties of genes that might be resistant to pests, diseases or other conditions. <br> 
					<br>
					⟫Types:The genetic diversity has three different sources: mutation, recombination and immigration of genes. <br> Mutation: Mutation is the driving force of genetic variation and evolution.<br>Recombination:  Recombination is a process by which pieces of DNA are broken and recombined to produce new combinations of alleles. <br> Immigration: Immigration is the second way that people are added to the population. This is the constant influx of new people into the population.<br>
					<br>
					⟫ Threats:threats to genetic diversity are habitat degradation and loss, deforestation, fragmentation, pathogens, invasive and allochthonous species, environmental pollution, global climate change, etc. <br>
					<br> 
					⟫ Conservation: Activities like specific selection for harvesting, destruction of natural habitats lead to loss of diversity.<br>

					Genes which get lost might be having many benefits, so it is important to conserve diversity for human well-being and to protect a species from getting extinct.<br>
					
					In cases of drought or a sudden outbreak of disease when the whole crop is destroyed, it is possible to grow genetically diverse and disease-resistant species by conserving diversity. <br> 
					<br>
					⟫ Higher genetic diversity within a population can also enhance its resilience to environmental stressors by increasing the likelihood that some individuals will possess traits that confer resistance or tolerance to adverse conditions. <br>
					<br>

			<article id="population"  style="background-color: #ffffffc0;">
				<h2 class="major"><b>Population of Species</b></h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="./images/population.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""/></span>
				<p> ⟫According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), there are approximately 8.7 million species on Earth, but only 1.2 million of these species have been scientifically described and catalogued.<br>
				    ⟫ Of these 1.2 million described species, around 41,000 are considered threatened with extinction.<br>
					⟫ The remaining 7.2 million species are still undiscovered and waiting to be discovered.<br><br>
					<h4> Population of species in India</h4>
					⟫ In India, the estimated number of species is around 90,000, with around 50,000 species of plants and around 20,000 species of animals. The remaining species include fungi, bacteria, and microorganisms.<br>
					⟫ However, despite India’s rich biodiversity, many species are facing threats due to habitat loss, over-exploitation, climate change, and other human activities. For example, over one-third of India’s mammal species are considered to be at risk of extinction, including the Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, and one-horned rhinoceros.<br>
					⟫ In conclusion, Earth’s biodiversity is a valuable resource that provides us with numerous benefits. However, it is under threat from various human activities, and it is up to us to ensure that future generations can enjoy its benefits.<br>
