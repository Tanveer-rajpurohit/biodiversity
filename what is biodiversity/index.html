						<h1>Introduction to<br />
						BIodiversity</h1>
						<p>The great variety of life on earth has provided
							for man's needs over thousands of years. This
							diversity of living creatures forms a support system which has been used by each civilization
							for its growth and development. Those that used
							this “bounty of nature” carefully and sustainably
							survived. Those that overused or misused it disintegrated</p>
							<br>
							<p>If an alien from a distant galaxy were to visit our planet
								Earth, the first thing that would amaze and baffle him
								would most probably be the enormous diversity of life
								that he would encounter. Even for humans, the rich variety
								of living organisms with which they share this planet never
								ceases to astonish and fascinate us. The common man
								would find it hard to believe that there are more than
								20,000 species of ants, 3,00,000 species of beetles, 28,000
								species of fishes and nearly 20,000 species of orchids.
								Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have been trying
								to understand the significance of such diversity by asking
								important questions Why are there so many species?
								Did such great diversity exist throughout earth's history?
								How did this diversification come about? How and why
								is this diversity important to the biosphere? Would it
								function any differently if the diversity was much less?
								How do humans benefit from the diversity of life?</p>

								<h2>What is Biodiversity</h2>
								<p>Biological diversity deals with the degree of
									nature's variety in the biosphere. This variety can
									be observed at three levels; the genetic variabil-
									ity within a species, the variety of species within
									a community, and the organisation of species
									in an area into distinctive plant and animal com-
									munities constitutes ecosystem diversity.</p>
									<br>
									<p><b>Definition:</b></p>
										<p>'Biological diversity' or biodiversity is that part
										of nature which includes the differences in genes
										among the individuals of a species, the variety
										and richness of all the plant and animal species
										at different scales in space, locally, in a region,
										in the country and the world, and various types
										of ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic,
										within a defined area.</p>

								<h2>Importance of Biodiversity</h2>
									<p>Biodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth, including humans. Without a wide range of animals, plants and microorganisms, we cannot have the healthy ecosystems that we rely on to provide us with the air we breathe and the food we eat. And people also value nature of itself.</p>
									<p>Some aspects of biodiversity are instinctively widely valued by people but the more we study biodiversity the more we see that all of it is important - even bugs and bacteria that we can't see or may not like the look of. There are lots of ways that humans depend upon biodiversity and it is vital for us to conserve it. Pollinators such as birds, bees and other insects are estimated to be responsible for a third of the world's crop production. Without pollinators we would not have apples, cherries, blueberries, almonds and many other foods we eat. Agriculture is also reliant upon invertebrates - they help to maintain the health of the soil crops grow in.  Soil is teeming with microbes that are vital for liberating nutrients that plants need to grow, which are then also passed to us when we eat them. Life from the oceans provides the main source of animal protein for many people.</p>
